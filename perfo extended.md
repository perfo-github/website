the perfo philosphy can be about more than windows apps. that's where perfo extended comes in. 

books
learning from books falls perfectly into the perfo philosphy. most perfo users really like learning from books, because they are information rich and very complete(they cover most infomation about a certain topic). we believe that the best way to learn programming is to sit with a book and a computer at a desk. 

websites
* [hacker news](https://news.ycombinator.com/) - the site that inspired this entire project. hacker news is a near-perfect example of perfo on the web. 
* [near's domain](https://saveweb.github.io/near.sh/)

historically (things that would have been perfo if they were updated. there are too many to list, but here are some of our favourites):
* windows 7 - the ultimate perfo operating system. beautiful. balanced. it did not sacrifice design for functionality. the aero glassmorhpism design is still one of the best ever, and we sure hope someone brings it back.
