perfo is a philiosphy. It stands for 'performance oriented'.

about:
perfo is a philosophy for modern windows applications that have a performance oriented ui and ux. we believe that there can exist apps that are modern and gode-looking without having a bloated uis that are slow. if you believe this too, then you are in the right place. 

what perfo is about:
* fast
* snappy

what perfo is not about:
* rounded corners
* excessive whitespace
* slow and laggy animations
* large fonts we wish were smaller
* requiring internet for basic tasks

examples of perfo apps:
* Everything - a perfect perfo app.
* Hyper - a perfect perfo app.
* qBittorent - a pefect perfo app. we believe it's implementations of the 'app ribbon' and 'search' are the best ever, and should be used as inspiration for other apps.
* VLC - 72% perfo.
* Notepad++ - 90% perfo. icons are old and ui is cluttered (you can't be performance oriented if you're going through a thousand options everytime you want to take action). but besides that, it is a shining example of what a perfo app can be.
* 7zip - 98% perfo. except for the win95 looking icons, 7zip is a perfect perfo application.
* AutoHotKey Help - 95% perfo. We belive that this help app should be the future of all help apps. it's ui is gorgeous without sacrificing perfo. it's only issue is that it's a very tiny bit slow, but we believe that can be optimized with time.
* ClassicShell/OpenShell - 99% perfo. the world's best start menu imo. there's a tiny bit of lag when opening, otherwise it's perfect.
* KeePass 2
* TeraCopy
* Sysinternals Process Explorer
* Recuva
* nomacs image viewer
* OBS Studio
* MarkdownPad 2
* MPC-HC (Media Player Classic)
* Lapce

do you think an app should be on this list? add it to this file on github and open a pr. we'll evaluate the addition soon.
